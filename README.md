```python
# POSSIBLE_OPTIONS=list(filter(lambda x:" " in x,NAME_LIST))

answer=choice(list(filter(lambda cur: cur.Name in POSSIBLE_OPTIONS,DATA)))
```

## Dependencies
- Nicegui
- Pillow
- requests
- pywebview
## [Devlog](Devlog.md)
I document my thought process and making process of this.

### Future Improvements?
**Optimisation?**
It takes **REALLY** long to start, I have no idea how 2 solve for now...\
Nicegui is a web-based guiüò•, so its expected to take humongous amount of resources\
Query speed is acceptable for this data size\
maybe data loading and can be optimised.

The different "Mode" "Forms" "Mega" of the same pokemon are treated as different entities,\
Might want to merge them under one tab (But data isnt even categorised in this way...)

Async function will cause **the previous search results continue to appear even after the search ends**
Add terminations to solve (I dont have much knowledge on that yet...)

Theme, colour scheme, fonts\
Ppl are not gonna notice anyways ‚îå( ¬¥_„Çù` )‚îê
